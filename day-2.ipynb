    "# Day 2: Simplicial Homology \n",
    "Today we will look at simplicial homology and computing the betti number. First, it may be beneficial to cement your understanding of simplicial homology by considering the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Given a torus, why is $\\beta_1 = 2$? What is $\\beta_2$ of a torus? \n",
    "2) What is $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ of a two-hold torus? \n",
    "3) What is $\\beta_1$ of a sphere with three holes? "
